For this school project I worked with a classmate to create the app Boomshine.

We designed the game with an Object-oriented programming approach. Using Java for the game logic and Andriod Studio to make the game interactive.

Rules of the game
Click on the screen to create a growing bubble
You get a point by a little bubble colliding into the bubble you created
The goal is to get the points needed to move on to the next level
You get 3 attempts per level before it is game over.
